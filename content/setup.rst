Access to Vega
===============

You should have recieved your username from the Vega support with the help of our
colleagues at ENCCS. One important step to login to the system is to generate an SSH key
and upload your public to the server. You can read it in `the Vega documentation <https://doc.vega.izum.si/ssh/>`_.

Once the setup is completed, you can login to the system. While the `Singularity`
module is readily avaiable in the login node, we should book a compute node to run
our examples. You can book a node for 1 hour using this command

.. code-block :: bash

  salloc -n 1 -t 1:00:00

Once the allocation is granted you will receive a message similar to

.. code-block :: bash

  salloc: Pending job allocation 24122556
  salloc: job 24122556 queued and waiting for resources
  salloc: job 24122556 has been allocated resources
  salloc: Granted job allocation 24122556
  salloc: Waiting for resource configuration
  salloc: Nodes cn0381 are ready for job

The granted compute node here is `cn0381`. In general from the compute node will
be similar like `cn0XXX`. Now you should SSH to the compute node to run interactively
our job using the command

.. code-block :: bash

  ssh cn0381

You might get a warning regarding the authenticity of the host, similar to the
output below.

.. code-block :: bash

The authenticity of host 'cn0381 (<no hostip for proxy command>)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:0BOlvbjVPLytjYEium04uNTCACCQN/Rr7NMJhje30aw.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added 'cn0381' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.

Please enter `yes` to the quesiton and igonre it as it is a self-assigned useless check
that doen't understand what is the purpose of our login. Now, we are able to run
our jobs interactively.

To run Jupyter Notebooks, we need to load Anaconda module.

.. code block ::

module load Anaconda3/2020.11

Afterwards, you can run a Jupyter kernel by specifying the port number and ip address.
The ip address here is the name of compute node, in the example given above is `cn0381`.

.. code-block :: bash

  jupyter-notebook --no-browser --port=8888 --ip=cn0381

The result should look like

.. code-block :: bash

[I 13:21:26.105 NotebookApp] JupyterLab extension loaded from /cvmfs/sling.si/modules/el7/software/Anaconda3/2020.11/lib/python3.8/site-packages/jupyterlab

    To access the notebook, open this file in a browser:
        file:///ceph/hpc/home/euhosseine/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/nbserver-339349-open.html
    Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
        http://cn0381:8888/?token=80d695595aa333c6d97dc6f868f96b36f4812622a5008090
     or http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=80d695595aa333c6d97dc6f868f96b36f4812622a5008090

In your local machin (PC/laptop), open a terminal and use this command to tunnel to the running kernel on Vega.

.. code-block :: bash

  ssh -N -f -L 8888:cn0381:8888 euhosseine@vglogin0005.vega.izum.si

The first port number is for your local machine and the second port number is what
you specified above running a Jupyter Notebook. Open a brower, and enter `http://localhost:8888`.
You should see a prompt to enter the passowrd or the token. The token in this run is `80d695595aa333c6d97dc6f868f96b36f4812622a5008090`.
Entering the token, you will be shown the tree of structure of home folder.

To use TensorFlow or Horovod in this course, we can simply load them through module system.

.. code-block :: bash

  module load TensorFlow
  module load Horovod
