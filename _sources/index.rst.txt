Upscaling AI with Containers
====================================

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a foundational building block of our modern world. 
Accordingly, a vast effort has been put into bringing AI to researchers and practitioners of a wide range of fields. 
Nonetheless, the computationally intensive task of training an AI increasingly requires more computational power than what our laptops and PCs can offer. Therefore, the ability to develop and train a neural network on large clusters seems imperative. This workshop teaches us how to scale an AI-powered application in large clusters, i.e., supercomputers.

.. prereq::
   
   Working knowledge of Unix OS is required. In addition, a basic understanding of Neural Networks (NNs) is desirable. 
   Please follow the `link <https://hub.docker.com>`_ to create a username and password on the DockerHub website, as we will use `Play-with-Docker (PWD) <https://labs.play-with-docker.com>`_ freely available service. 
   Details of using and access to the cluster are given in :doc:`setup` section.
